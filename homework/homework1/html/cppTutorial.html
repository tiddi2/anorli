                On this page we are going to create a computer program. A computer program is A sequence of instructions that tell the computer what to do.
                To get started programing we need two things. An editor and knowlegde of a programming language.
                We will be learning c++ in this tutorial.
                Lets code hello world together.
                <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int main()
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, world!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
    We need to include the iostream to be able to output anything on the screen.
    Before the computer can run this code we need to compile it. A compiler got two jobs.
    Check that the code is allowed according to the rules of the programming language you are using.
    If that is true, it will turn the code into machine code so that the CPU can understand what to do with it.
