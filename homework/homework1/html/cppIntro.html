                C++ is a programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983. <br>
                It is an addition to the C programming language. The reason C++ got so famous is because it is object oriented. <br>
                The language is very powerful and flexable and c++ has a philosophy "trust the programmer". <br>
                That means you as a programmer are allowed to do whatever you want as long as it follows the rules of c++. <br>
